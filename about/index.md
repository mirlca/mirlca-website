This project aims at creatively exploring the use of big collections of sound data in live coding performance through the use of machine learning and music information retrieval algorithms and the use of a live coder virtual agent companion that can complement a human live coder in her/his practice. The core themes of *legibility*, *agency* and *negotiability* in performance are researched by means of the collaboration between the human live coder, the virtual agent live coder and the audience.

Stay tuned about forthcoming online workshops and concerts during Winter 2020 until Spring 2021!
