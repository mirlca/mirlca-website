As a follow-up of the workshops to be held in London (IKLECTIK), Barcelona (L'Ull Cec) and Leicester (Leicester Hackspace), the original plan was to held three on-site concerts in London (IKLECTIK), Barcelona (Phonos), and Leicester (MTI^2, De Montfort University). Due to the pandemic, we are adapting the original idea to what it is currently possible with an emphasis to the online experience. 

## London (IKLECTIK)

IKLECTIK [off-site] presents,

### Similar Sounds: A Virtual Agent in Live Coding
#### Two performances and a Q&A panel with Sam Roig (L'Ull Cec) and Iván Paz (TOPLAP). 

After the 2 performances the event will continue with a Q&A panel with the musicians, moderated by Sam Roig (L’Ull Cec). The audience is invited to ask questions on the YouTube Live Chat.

Gerard Roma is a musician and music technology researcher from Barcelona. He performs and releases electronic music under different aliases. His music often involves sound databases, processed field recordings and general audio mangling, either via live coding or visual exploration. His work has been presented in Spain, UK, USA, Ireland, Norway and Germany.

Anna Xambó is a Senior Lecturer in Music and Audio Technology at De Montfort University and an experimental electronic music producer. Her research and practice focus on new interfaces for music performance looking at live coding, collaborative and participatory music systems, and multichannel spatialisation. Her solo and group performances have been presented internationally in Denmark, Germany, Norway, Spain, Sweden, UK and USA. To date, she has released three solo recordings: “init” (2010, Carpal Tunnel), “On the Go” (2013, Carpal Tunnel) and “H2RI” (2018, pan y rosas.

Iván Paz studied physics and mathematics at the National Autonomous University of México (UNAM). During this time, he also experimented with music and photography. His main interests involve science, art, technology, and how their interactions can create new aesthetic, conceptual and thinking directions. In 2006 Iván started working as an audio engineering professor. From this process, in 2011 he conceived and leaded a seminar in mathematical methods applied to music composition at UNAM. The activity developed there, produced several collaborations and working processes, for example live coding sessions in collaboration with the National Centre of the Arts of México (NCA). His current work involves artificial intelligence methodologies for the study of musical features and parameter spaces exploration of generative systems. Iván Paz is currently member of TOPLAP Barcelona.

Since 2006, helped by a fuzzy network of collaborators, Sam Roig has been directing l'Ull Cec, a cultural organization that has produced a wide assortment of public events and artistic projects related to sonic arts and experimental music, as well as dissemination activities around audio technology topics related to these disciplines. He is currently a PhD candidate at the University of Huddersfield.
