As a follow-up of the workshops to be held in London (IKLECTIK), Barcelona (L'Ull Cec) and Leicester (Leicester Hackspace), the original plan was to held three on-site concerts in London (IKLECTIK), Barcelona (Phonos), and Leicester (MTI^2, De Montfort University). Due to the pandemic, we are adapting the original idea to what it is currently possible with an emphasis to the online experience. 

We will announcing the dates of the concerts very soon, which will be scheduled from December 2020 to February 2021. Please stay tuned!
