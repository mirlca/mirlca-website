This blog post presents the project's presence at the Web Audio Conference (WAC) 2021, held in Barcelona, July 5-7, 2021. 

## Keynote

This year I had the honour to be invited to give a keynote talk at the [Web Audio Conference 2021](https://webaudioconf2021.com), which was programmed on July 5, 2021. The keynote is entitled "Grassrouters Music Performance" and reflects on my previous work on network music, audience engagement, and live coding. 

Due to the still ongoing pandemic, the conference was online and the WAC 2021 committee suggested adding interactive components during the session. I designed the presentation on [Miro](https://miro.com) and prepared 3 small capsules with a participatory element at the end of each of the three main parts of the talk. You can watch the presentation on the following video.

The other keynote speakers were [Anna Huang](https://research.google/people/105787/), who is Research Scientist at Google Brain, and [Juanjo Montiel](https://www.kastwey.org/), who is a Senior Software Engineer and Microsoft Accessibility MVP.

## Performance

I had also the opportunity to perform a live coding session with MIRLCa at WAC 2021. The challenge here was to design a performance to be delivered on Zoom. In order to cover the full global timezone, the performance was scheduled twice on the same day, on July 6, 2021. I decided to perform live on two occasions.

### Performance 1

### Performance 2

In the two performances, I explore chance by using a set of four dice that trigger a number used to retrieve sounds from Freesound by its sound identifier. The paradox, in this case, is that the agent that filters sound by preference does not have sense with this command. In the follow-up discussion of the first performance, Frederic Font from Freesound.org suggested that you could still retrieve the best candidate if the current target was predicted as a bad sound. Something to consider for the future, certainly.
