It is our pleasure to announce the new album release Dirty Dialogues on Chicago netlabel [pan y rosas discos](https://www.panyrosasdiscos.org), a collaboration between [Dirty Electronics Ensemble](https://www.dirtyelectronics.org) led by [John Richards](/posts/interview-with-john-richards), [Jon.Ogara](/posts/interview-with-jon-ogara) and Anna Xambó. The album art and design have been carefully crafted by [Angela Guyton](https://www.angelaguyton.com), who has created amazing album designs (see [here](http://www.angelaguyton.com/2020/01/design/)). 

The digital album includes a booklet that has been designed to be print-friendly. On one side of the booklet, there is all the information about the live album production and the team involved. On the other side, there is an A3 poster of the album cover. The booklet is part of the digital album download. 

Here's the press release of the album:

> *Dirty Dialogues* is an encounter between Dirty Electronics Ensemble, Jon.Ogara and Anna Xambó in a free music improvisation session after a long pandemic lockdown. Thirteen musicians on stage combining analogue and digital instruments, acoustic and electronic materials, live coding and DIY sound-making techniques. An intense polymorphic journey of sonic exploration and chaos, which is especially recommended for noise music lovers.

The album was recorded on May 17, 2021, at PACE (De Montfort University) with no audience due to COVID-19 restrictions. The event was organised by MTI2, De Montfort University in collaboration with l’ull cec.
