We are proud to announce that the project has been virtually present in Shanghai, China, during the celebration of the annual international conference [New Interfaces for Musical Expression 2021](http://nime2021.org/), which is unique of its kind. 

We presented the following two pieces of work:

* The long paper: Xambó, A., Roma, G., Roig, S., & Solaz, E. (2021). Live Coding with the Cloud and a Virtual Agent. International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression. Retrieved from [https://nime.pubpub.org/pub/zpdgg2fg](https://nime.pubpub.org/pub/zpdgg2fg). Conference webpage at [http://nime2021.org/program/#/paper/114](http://nime2021.org/program/#/paper/114).
* The performance session: Xambó, A. (2021). A Live Coding Session With the Cloud and a Virtual Agent. International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression. Retrieved from [https://nime.pubpub.org/pub/tmqan4a2](https://nime.pubpub.org/pub/tmqan4a2). Conference webpage at [http://nime2021.org/program/#/music/235](http://nime2021.org/program/#/music/235).

For the paper presentation, we had to prepare a 4-minute video explaining the main points of the paper. Then, we had allocated two 1-hour sessions on June 15, 2021, which spanned across one day. This was designed to cover all the potential time zones. For this event, we had the opportunity to present our research in the form of a Q&A poster presentation via Zoom. Next, you can watch the video.

The Q&A poster presentation was, to a certain extent, lively. I found that visitors came with specific questions after watching the video. It would have been nice to be able to watch the other presenters allocated at the same time, which was possible only partially. 

The next challenge was to participate in the live Algorave on June 17, 2021, with both an online and on-site audience. The event was happening in a club in Shanghai, but all the performers were streaming online via [OBS.Ninja](https://obs.ninja/). In my performance, I decided to add a chat to unite the audience. They were invited to suggest "tags" that I could use to query sounds from the Freesound database. To my surprise, the chat was used too openly, which indicates that I should contextualize better why this chat is designed to be used. In any case, it was nice to notice the telepresence of the audience in a lively, interactive manner, given that I was not able to see the concert venue nor the audience. Next, you can watch the video of my performance (starting at 36:18). I recommend the full event.
