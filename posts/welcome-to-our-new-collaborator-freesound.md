It is our pleasure to welcome our new collaborator: Freesound. Welcome!

[Freesound](https://freesound.org/) aims to create a huge collaborative database of audio snippets, samples, recordings, bleeps, ... released under Creative Commons licenses that allow their reuse. Freesound provides new and interesting ways of accessing these samples, check it out!

We are using the Freesound API via the [Freesound quark](https://github.com/g-roma/Freesound.sc) to develop our virtual agent on top of SuperCollider and [MIRLC](https://github.com/axambo/MIRLC).
